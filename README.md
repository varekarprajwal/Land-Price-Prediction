# Land Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **price of land** based on multiple features such as **area, proximity to city, soil fertility, water source availability, weather conditions, and year** using **Linear Regression** in Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Preprocessing of categorical variables using **Label Encoding**
- **StandardScaler** for feature scaling
- Model training using **Linear Regression**
- Model evaluation with **RÂ² score** and **RMSE**
- Visualization: **Actual vs Predicted Prices**
- Interactive user input for prediction
- Support for **SI units** (area converted from acres to square meters)
- Output formatting in **Lakhs and Crores (INR)**

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset should be named **`data.csv`** and must contain the following columns:
- `Area` (in acres)
- `Near city` (Yes/No or categorical)
- `Soil fertility` (categorical)
- `Water Source` (categorical)
- `Weather condtion` (categorical)
- `Year` (integer)
- `Price` (in INR)
